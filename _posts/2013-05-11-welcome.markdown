Hello and welcome to my new blog. I have been thinking about setting up a blog for a while for a number of reasons. I wanted a place to experiment and try new things. I also wanted somewhere that would be a home for a 'profesional brand' you might say. So this blog is mostly about web development and techniques I try and use. 


I have built this site using Jekyll. I had seen a lot of people use it and I wanted to have a go. After I created a simple design it was actually really easy to set up and use. I've hosted it on Github also so there is a transparency in all I do on here. Also, enables anyone to correct spelling etc in pull requests.


This will do for now as an introduction. It is __hugely__ work in process so you have been warned. I will write up about my style guide and a colophon on how I built the blog and I what I used. But for now, keep your eyes pealed for more posts and design changes as time goes on.
