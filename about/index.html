      <h2 class="u-emoji u-emoji--thinking">Belief</h2>
      <p>I believe that technologies purpose is to improve peoples’ lives, be
        that of an individual, a society or a business. Technology is a tool
        that when utilised properly can bring great and powerful change. I find
        the possibility of this transformation exciting and it inspires me to
        explore the many ways this can be achieved. I always seek to be learning
        new and different methods so that I can be a forerunner in bringing
        about that change.</p>
